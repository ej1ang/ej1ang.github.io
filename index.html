                    Hello, I’m Eric Jiang, I am currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science with a minor in
                    statistics at the University of Alberta.
                    In my time as a student at the University, I have built games engines in both object oreintated and
                    entity component system methodologies. I have built a website, not including this one. in addition I
                    plan on releasing a minecraft mod of my own in the future.

                    I have a strong interest in statistics and have completed coursework covering probability theory,
                    statistical inference, and applied data analysis, with an emphasis on interpreting data and drawing
                    meaningful conclusions.

                    game engines. It is a 2D platformer that involves the use of different spells to accomplish
                    different things.

                <p> This is team Project Black's version of a website called Social distribution. It features a backend
                    utilizing Django. The frontend is made using a mix of React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer
                    Motion. The website is able to interact with other teams who made this project. Posts and friends
                    are shared across different teams. The video below was used as a promotional video for the website
                    our team made.
